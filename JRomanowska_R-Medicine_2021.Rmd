## Drug design: research question

Drug design - how is it actually formulated as a basic research question?
In a way it's a jigsaw puzzle - we have an enzyme, a protein inside our body
that needs to be fixed with a certain compound, a drug. So we need to
design this compound so that it fits the protein as good as possible.

But, there's more - we don't really know which protein we need to focus on
and it's estimated that we have more than 20k proteins. On top of that, if we
assume that we can build a compound from scratch in any way, there can be 
almost 100mln possibilities! Thankfully, not all of those can be used as a
drug - we exclude some automatically based on e.g., their toxicity or
insolubility, but up to date there are almost 10k compounds classified
as drugs.

## Traditional drug design

1. _Basic research:_    
find the protein to target

2. _Computational drug design:_    
find the best drug __candidates__

3. _Experimental research:_    
check the candidates __in vitro__ and __in vivo__

4. _Clinical trials:_    
3 phases before accepting + phase 4

--

**Disadvantages:**

- very long time
- billions of dollars
- 88% of candidate drugs fail

???

So many drugs are already on the market, so we need to use this data!
That's were the registries come in handy...

## New paradigm:
### drug repurposing

- virtual clinical tests - _Norwegian registry data_
- experimental confirmation in animal models
- explore the drug targets    
and similar drugs

???

- __drug repurposing__
- no rejection due to unknown side-effects
- many virtual confirmation tests can be done
- confirmation of molecular action in animal models

- registry-based epidemiology:

  - no bias
  - translational design
  - agnostic search

## DRONE =
### Drug Repurposing
### fOr NEurological diseases

- entire prescription registry of Norway

  - `>`670 mln prescriptions    
  (4.6 mln Norwegians, 2004 - 2019)
  - `>`1800 various drugs
  - size in the memory: 105 GB

- Norwegian patient registry

- Statistics Norway (SSB)

???

- _Neurological diseases:_ PD, MS, ALS

## Methods & techniques

- *internal* R-package to ease access to data
    - `usethis` <img style="width: 30px;" src="https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" alt="usethis R-package logo"/>
    - custom templates for Rmarkdown reports
    - `RSQLite` and `dbplyr` <img style="width: 30px;" src="https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" alt="dbplyr R-package logo"/>

--

- data visualization: *passive* and *interactive*
    - `ggplot2` <img style="width: 30px;" src="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" alt="ggplot2 R-package logo"/>
    - `flexdashboard` <img style="width: 30px;" src="https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard/raw/master/man/figures/logo.png" alt="flexdashboard R-package logo"/>

## Exemplary results

### Analysis type:

- Cox-regression
- exposure: *min. 2 prescriptions of a drug*
- outcome:    
*PD diagnosis* defined as *min. 4 prescriptions of levodopa*
- study population:    
*entire population of Norway on 01-01-2015*
- dataset:    
*entire Prescription Registry* (all the prescriptions in entire Norway between 01-01-2014 and 31-12-2019)
